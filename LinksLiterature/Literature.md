## Books
### Univariate Statistics

* Crawley, M. J. 2015. Statistics: An Introduction Using R. Wiley & Sons,
Chichester. - *Good and comprehensive introduction to univariate statistics and R, just
updated*

* Dormann, C. F. 2013. Parametrische Statistik Verteilungen, maximum
likelihood und GLM in R. Springer: Berlin; Heidelberg. - *In german! Excellent introduction into ecologically-relevant methods of univariate data analysis.*

* Fox, J. 2008. Applied Regression Analysis and Generalized Linear Models. 2nd edition. Sage Publications, Thousand Oaks, California. - *The book comprises about 660 pages and covers all subjects in the field of
linear models in sufficient detail. A good standard reference*

* Fox, J. 2011. An R Companion to Applied Regression. 2nd edition. Sage Publications, Thousand Oaks, California. - *An addition to Fox (2008). It describes the implementation of statistical methods in R*

* Logan, M. 2010. Biostatistical Design and Analysis Using R. Wiley-Blackwell, Hoboken NJ. - *Well structured book for all fields of biostatistics and their implementation in R.* 

* Zuur, A.F., 2013. A beginner’s guide to GLM and GLMM with R: a frequentist and Bayesian perspctive for ecologists. Highland Statistics, Newburgh. - *Nice little book with focus on application with R*

### Multivariate Statistics

* Borcard, D.; Gillet, F.; Legendre, P. 2011. Numerical ecology with R. Springer: New York, NY. - *R implementation of the classical textbook (see below). However, the powerful techniques of permutational MANOVA (PERMANOVA) and SIMPER are not included*

* Kindt, R.; Coe, R. 2005. Tree diversity analysis. A manual and software for common statistical methods for ecological and biodiversity studies. Nairobi, Kenya: World Agroforestry Centre. - *Freely available, so have a look! Covers most of the multivariate techniques (but not PERMANOVA). [Link (pdf)](http://www.worldagroforestry.org/downloads/publications/PDFs/B13695.pdf)*

* Legendre, P., and L. Legendre. 2012. Numerical Ecology. Elsevier, Amsterdam. - *Certainly the standard textbook for ecologists. A beginner may need some time to get used to the style. Nevertheless the most recommendable book in the field of multivariate statistics in ecology.*

* Zuur, A. F., Ieno, E. N. and G. M. Smith 2007. Analysing Ecological Data. Series: Statistics for Biology and Health. - *The only work so far which deals exclusively with the analysis of ecological data. All important methods are presented – for this reason some topics are not treated in detail. There is a special section on case studies, demonstrating strategies of data analysis. Most analyses are done in R and the code is available.*


### Spatial Statistics

* Bivand, R.S., 2013. Applied spatial data analysis with R. Springer.
